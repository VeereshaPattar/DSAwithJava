üîë Common DSA Patterns
1. Sliding Window
[text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHCGAZBbB88&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeM8BDJmIYDaoQ5zuwyxnfj&index=1)
Used for subarrays/substrings, when you need to maintain a "window" over data.

Problems:

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

Minimum Window Substring

2. Two Pointers
Refs : 
[text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzvpK8zTHU&list=PLpIkg8OmuX-LtRw7om1-EV6aJMRKjbSSR)
One pointer at start, one at end (or slow/fast pointer).

Problems:

Two Sum (sorted array)

3Sum / 4Sum

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Linked list cycle detection
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare)

Special case of two pointers, often in linked lists.

Problems:

Detect Cycle in Linked List

Find Middle Node of Linked List

4. Prefix Sum / Difference Array

Precompute sums to answer range queries quickly.

Problems:

Subarray Sum Equals K

Range Sum Query (Immutable/Mutable)

5. Hashing / Frequency Map

Use HashMap/HashSet to count, check duplicates, store indexes.

Problems:

Two Sum (unsorted)

Group Anagrams

Longest Consecutive Sequence

6. Binary Search

Search in sorted arrays, or on the answer space.

Problems:

Binary Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Search Insert Position

Find Minimum in Rotated Array

Aggressive Cows / Allocate Books (binary search on answer)

7. Sorting + Greedy

Sort the input, then make greedy choices.

Problems:

Activity Selection Problem

Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

Interval Scheduling / Merge Intervals

8. Backtracking

Try all possibilities (DFS style), undo (backtrack).

Problems:

N-Queens

Sudoku Solver

Generate Parentheses

Subsets / Permutations

9. Dynamic Programming (DP)

Break problem into subproblems + store results.

Categories:

1D DP ‚Üí Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs

2D DP ‚Üí Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance

Knapsack DP ‚Üí Subset Sum, Coin Change

DP on Strings ‚Üí Palindrome Partitioning

10. Graph Traversal

BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find.

Problems:

Number of Islands

Shortest Path in Graph

Detect Cycle in Graph

Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal/Prim)

11. Heap / Priority Queue

Get min/max efficiently.

Problems:

Kth Largest Element

Merge K Sorted Lists

Top K Frequent Elements

12. Monotonic Stack / Queue

Stack or queue that maintains monotonic property.

Problems:

Next Greater Element

Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Trapping Rain Water

13. Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

Group elements efficiently.

Problems:

Connected Components

Kruskal‚Äôs MST

Accounts Merge

14. Bit Manipulation

Use XOR, AND, OR to solve problems.

Problems:

Single Number (XOR trick)

Subsets using bits

Count set bits

15. Matrix Traversal

BFS/DFS on 2D grid.

Problems:

Rotting Oranges

Word Search

Spiral Matrix

üîë A Better Approach to Learn DSA Patterns
1. First Pass ‚Äì Breadth (Shallow)

Read all patterns at a high level (just understand the ‚Äútheme‚Äù).

Don‚Äôt deep dive yet.

Example: ‚ÄúSliding Window is for subarrays/substrings with continuous property.‚Äù

2. Second Pass ‚Äì Depth (Practice Core Problems)

Pick 1‚Äì2 classic problems per pattern and solve them.

Don‚Äôt try to master the entire pattern at once.

Example:

Sliding Window ‚Üí "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"

Two Pointers ‚Üí "Two Sum (sorted array)"

3. Spaced Repetition (Revision Loop)

After finishing 2‚Äì3 patterns, go back and re-solve 1 problem from earlier patterns.

This way, older concepts stay fresh while you‚Äôre learning new ones.

4. Pattern Notebook / Cheatsheet

Maintain your own pattern summary notes:

Pattern Name

When to apply

One template code

2‚Äì3 example problems

This will act as your personal reference book.

5. Mix Easy, Medium, Hard

Don‚Äôt grind only easy problems ‚Üí mix.

Example: 1 easy + 1 medium from Sliding Window ‚Üí move on.

When you return to Sliding Window later, try 1 hard problem.

6. Weekly Revision

Every weekend, quickly revisit your solved problems:

Can I solve it again without looking at code?

Do I remember the pattern?

7. Mock Interview Practice

Once you‚Äôve done most patterns once, start doing mixed sets of problems (random LeetCode practice).

This simulates the interview ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be told ‚Äúthis is a sliding window problem‚Äù.
