🚀 Interview Prep Learning Path (Java DSA)
Step 1: Basics & Foundation

Big-O Notation → time/space complexity analysis.

Arrays & Strings

Two pointers, sliding window, prefix/suffix sums.

Common problems: subarray sum, anagrams, longest substring, matrix rotation.

Step 2: Core Data Structures

Linked List (reverse, detect cycle, merge two sorted lists).

Stack & Queue

Stack: valid parentheses, next greater element.

Queue: implement stack/queue using each other, sliding window maximum.

Priority Queue: Kth largest element, merge k-sorted lists.

Hashing (HashMap/HashSet) → frequency count, subarray problems.

Step 3: Non-Linear Structures

Trees

Traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order).

Height, diameter, balance check.

Binary Search Tree operations + LCA.

Heaps

Min/Max heap usage.

Heap sort, top-K problems.

Graphs

Traversals: BFS, DFS.

Shortest path: Dijkstra, BFS (unweighted).

Detect cycle in graph.

Tries (basic) → prefix search, autocomplete.

Step 4: Key Algorithms

Sorting & Searching

Binary Search (variants: first/last occurrence, rotated array, sqrt(x)).

Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

Greedy

Activity selection, minimum platforms, Huffman coding.

Dynamic Programming (DP)

Fibonacci, climbing stairs.

Knapsack, coin change, subset sum.

Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).

Step 5: Systematic Problem Practice

👉 Use LeetCode Top Interview Questions + GeeksforGeeks must-do DSA list.
Patterns to master:

Sliding Window

Binary Search variations

Recursion + Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku, subsets/permutations)

Graph traversal problems

Classic DP (Knapsack, LIS, LCS, DP on grids)

Step 6: Mock & Revision

Do timed practice (45–60 mins per problem set).

Review mistakes & note patterns.

Practice mock interviews (Pramp, LeetCode contests).
